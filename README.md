# 🌾 AgriClimate-QA-Chatbot

### 📘 Overview
AgriClimate-QA-Chatbot is an AI-based chatbot that answers natural language questions about agriculture and climate using real datasets from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in).  
It can tell you things like:
- Compare rainfall between two states
- Find the top crops in a state
- Analyze crop production trends over years

### 🧠 Objective
To make Indian agricultural data easier to access and understand — helping students, policymakers, and citizens make data-driven decisions.

### 🏗️ How It Works
1. **User asks a question** — e.g., “Compare rainfall in Bihar and UP for last 5 years.”
2. **Chatbot analyzes the question** and finds what it’s about (rainfall, crops, trends, etc.)
3. **It fetches data** from `.csv` files (from data.gov.in).
4. **It replies** with the answer and cites the data source.
